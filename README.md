## 🐳 Docker Instructions 

### 🛠️ Building the Docker Image 

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the root directory of the repository:

```sh
docker build -t ghcr.io/schbenedikt/search-engine:latest .
```

### 🚀 Running the Docker Container 

To run the Docker container, use the following command:

```sh
docker run -p 5555:5555 ghcr.io/schbenedikt/search-engine:latest
```

This will start the Flask application using Gunicorn as the WSGI server, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:5555`.

### 📥 Pulling the Docker Image 

The Docker image is publicly accessible. To pull the Docker image from GitHub Container Registry, use the following command:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/schbenedikt/search-engine:latest
```

### 📝 Note 
Ensure that the `tags` field in the GitHub Actions workflow is correctly set to `ghcr.io/schbenedikt/search-engine:latest` to avoid multiple packages.

### 🐳 Running with Docker Compose 

To run both the search engine and MongoDB containers using Docker Compose, use the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

This will start both containers and the Flask application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5555`.

### 📄 Docker Compose File 

The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to manage both the search engine and MongoDB containers. Here is an example of the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  search-engine:
    image: ghcr.io/schbenedikt/search-engine:latest
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    ports:
      - "5555:5555"

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

### 🗄️ Database Configuration 

The `db_config.json` file is used to store the database configuration. Here is an example of the `db_config.json` file:

```json
[
  {
    "url": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "name": "search_engine",
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
  }
]
```

### ⚙️ Settings Page 

The `settings.html` file has been updated to include fields for username and password. You can access the settings page at `http://localhost:5555/settings` to update the database configuration.
